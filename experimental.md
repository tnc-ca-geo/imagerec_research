##Misc. lab notes##

I tested TensorFlow's general purpose algorithm Inception-v3
trained on ImageNet. It does not perform well to detect tuna
(there have been some thousand tuna images, labeled as tuna in 
the training data set and it does not detect them).

I think the image set is quite good if we could succeed to detect
tuna by training on these.
