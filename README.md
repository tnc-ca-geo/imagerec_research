##Classification Data Sets##

Here are some examples for standard classification data sets used for bench marking of machine learning algorithms.

UCI Machine Learning Repository (this one does not have a lot of image data)

The Stanford University runs image-net.org which is a classified 
hierarchy of images. Among them hundreds (1299, found out how many). 
Images of tuna. ***Maybe we could use those for training*** and only 
apply the resulting product to the videos.


##University Research##

This article claims that the team could differentiate between four 
species of fish by 99.6% accuracy.
