##Questions to be answered##

1. Will we have enough data points to positively detect and 
identify certain by-catch species: e.g. turtles, dolphin (and
can we hand them over to the competing teams?)

2. We need example data as currently delivered by the vendors
who monitor the stream with humans. 

3. How much time do people spend to watch this footage. Assuming 
that they use fast-forward a lot, what is the ratio of watching
these videos to the actual length.


##Todo##

1. Obtain longer sequence for experimentation with certain algorithms.

##Questions for check-in##

1. Species list, is it mostly blue fin and/or yellow fin
