Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commmision (WCPFC) is the management agency that sets standards for data collection
by human observers. Below are the minimum data values people think can be possibly catpured usin camera systems coupled
with GPS and hydraulic sensors (known in the industry as "Electronic Monitoring" EM). Of these I think there's a subset
that could be addressed using computer vision algorithm approach.  Right now these values are created by "dry observers" 
sitting and reviewing video after the trip.  We want to augment that and make the process more efficient.

Date and time of fishing operations (start and end of sets and hauls);
Geospatial location of fishing operations;
Identification of species used for bait used in a trip;
Identification of hook shapes and sizes used in a trip;
Identification of leader materials used in a trip;
Identification of all catch, both retained and discarded, to the species level if possible, and including catch that is both landed on deck and catch that is removed from the gear without being landed on deck (i.e., struck off);
Hook number in between two floats on which each organism is caught;
Size of each caught organism, both for retained and discarded catch;
Number of hooks deployed per set;
Number of hooks between floats;
At-vessel (haulback) condition of all catch (alive vs. dead);
Condition of discarded/released catch (alive or dead when returned to the sea);
Hooking position of endangered, threatened and protected species (sea turtles, marine mammals, elasmobranchs, seabirds);
Gear remaining attached to discarded/released catch.
